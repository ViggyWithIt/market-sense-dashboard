**My full-stack web app for visualizing how financial news sentiment impacts stock prices.**

## Why I Built This

After my quantitative trading model was blindsided by a sudden news event, I realized that the numbers on the chart were only half the story. I became obsessed with the idea of seeing the "human" element—the fear and greed reflected in the news—right alongside the hard data. I wanted to build a tool that could bridge that gap.

Market-Sense is my answer. It's a web app that pulls daily stock prices and the latest financial news, analyzes the sentiment of the headlines, and then plots both on a single, interactive graph. This project was my deep dive into full-stack development, APIs, and the challenge of turning messy, real-world news into structured, visual data. It's my attempt to create a clearer, more contextual view of the market.

## What It Does

-   **Fetches daily stock prices and relevant news** for a given ticker using the Alpha Vantage API.
-   **Analyzes news headlines** to calculate an average daily sentiment score.
-   **Plots both price and sentiment** on an interactive Chart.js graph with two Y-axes for easy comparison.
-   **Built on a simple full-stack architecture** with a Python/Flask backend for data processing and a clean HTML/JS frontend for visualization.

## Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python, Flask
-   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
-   **Data Source:** Alpha Vantage API
-   **Libraries:** Requests
